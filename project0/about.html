		<h2>About this game</h2>
		</div>
		
		<div class="main">
			<span>This is an incremental game. it features:</span>
			<ul>
				<li>A Click Button</li>
				<li>Buildings</li>
				<li>Upgrades</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
<!--			<span>It distinguishes itself from other incrementals due to the following:</span>
			<ul>
				<li>Infinite amout of Buildings</li>
				<li>Cost Function</li>
				<li>Inflation</li>
				<li>Upgrades</li>
			</ul>
			<br>-->
			<span>How is it different <em>exactly</em>?</span>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<h4>Buildings</h4>
					<div>There is no <em>final</em> Building. Whenever you bought a certain amount of the <em>currently</em> last Building, a new one gets created, with higher cost and better revenue.</div>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<h4>Cost Function</h4>
					<div>Instead of a base cost in <em>Money</em>, the buildings base cost are given in <em>seconds of production</em>. That way, you have to wait at most that many seconds until you can buy the Building. But buying a Building with a high production is much more expensive than with a low production.</div>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<h4>Inflation</h4>
					<div>As the time to wait increments exponentially, you might have to wait decades to buy the next building. But luckily, there is inflation. It decreases the price of all Builings, which counters the exponential growth.</div>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<h4>Upgrades</h4>
					<div>TODO</div>
				</li>
			</ul>
